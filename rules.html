<h1> Rules of the Raceway </h1>

<p> This page gives a description of the rules of the race. I tried to detail as much as I could, but if 
you have any questions or want clarification of the rules let me know.</p>

<h2> Basic Mechanics of the Race </h2>

<p> The game will be played in rounds. Each round players get one action, one bonus action, and one reaction. 
Your action for one round will be decided based off the <a href="actions.html" class="link">action</a> that you decided to private message 
to the GM. Actions will be resolved in order based off the order of the initiative tracker. All opponents 
will take their turns after your chariot has resolved its actions first.</p>

<p> I will be using a success, fail, succeed with complications system for skill checks. Each check that I ask for 
during the race will have two DCs and roll 1 die, trying to beat both DCs. Passing 0 DCs is a fail, passing 1 DC is
a success with complications, and passing both DCs is a complete success.</p>

</br>

<h2> Movement Rules </h2>

<p> At the start of the race everyone's chariot begins with a current speed of 0. The ACCELERATE action increases
the current speed stat of your chariot. The DRIVE FORWARD action moves your chariot forward. Your chariot must move 
your entire current speed if possible. There are two things that can cause your chariot to not move it's entire speed: </p>

<ul>
	<li> If your chariot were to run into another chariot when you move your whole speed, your chariot will move
	up to the other chariot but not past it. </li>
	<li> If your chariot were to run into a wall when you move your whole speed, your chariot will stop at the 
	wall and your chariot will take -10 damage. </li>
</ul>

<p> Your chariot will move in a straight line in the direction that it is facing. The direction that your chariot is facing is
determined by the TURN RIGHT and TURN LEFT actions. The exception to this rule is taking a MANEUVER action. When taking 
the MANEUVER action, let the GM know what cool maneuver you want to take, like drifitng or ramming, and the GM can work 
out how your chariot will move. Know that your chariot cannot move more than it's current speed no matter what manuever 
you preform. </p>

</br>

<h2> Attacking Rules </h2>

<p> Attacks can target either the chariot or the riders. The horses and chariot count as one entity in terms of attacking
You cannot kill or incapacitate any chariots or horses; however, you can incapacitate riders. Attacks against chariots happen
the same as if you were attacking a creature. All damage that is dealt by the attack is subtracted from the health of the chariot.
You can attack and cast spells like normal if you decide to take the PLAYER ACTION.</p>

</br>

<h2> Health Rules </h2>

<p> Your chariot has a certain health pool that affects the maximum speed of your chariot. If your chariot loses more than 
half of its health, your maximum speed is reduced by half. If your chariot's health pool reaches 0, your max speed becomes 0. You 
can use the REPAIR action to heal your chariot. </p>

</br>

<h2> Reaction Rules </h2>

<p> Reactions work the same as normal combat. All players reactions reset on their collective turn. Remember that you 
can take the BREAK action as a reaction too. </p>

</br>

<h2> Ramming Rules </h2>

<p> Your team is allowed one ram per round. You are allowed to ram another chariot that is within range of your current speed.
	When ramming, you roll an animal handling check in place of an attack roll. If your check beats the AC of the cart that you 
	are ramming you can roll the ram damage of your cart. If you miss the chariot you are aiming for then your cart takes -10 
	damage and you do not move forward.</p>
